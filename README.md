# Name of Project: Mentor Matcher
## Dev Team Members: Sarah Teklemariam, Martha Quintanilla-Ramirez, Tanesha Brester, Vida Powell

# Project start date: 6-14-2022
Summary of idea: An app that connects minority children with an interest in a particular career path to a mentor. We would create our own database and seed it with mentors we identify through our tech networks!

What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough) “If you can’t see it, you can’t be it” - Many children in communities of color are not able to associate personally with someone in high-tech, or less prevalent careers. This app helps resolve this pain point by giving more transparency to the world beyond the child’s immediate experience.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?

The app would have to display an authenticated user profile as well as match options from our database. Mentors previously worked with will be displayed upon login.

# User Stories

### Title - One
- User Story sentence - As a parental user I want to ensure the safety of my child.

### Title - Two
- User Story sentence - As a user I want to see my past sessions when I log into my app.
- Feature Tasks - Implement Auth0 so that user only sees their information from the data base on login.
- Acceptance Tests - Dev team members log into authenticated sessions and confirm theyre only seeing relevent information. 

### Title - Three
- User Story sentence - As a user I want to be able to schedule future sessions with a mentor.
- Feature Tasks - Implement scheduling solution - TBD. That allows user to select from mentors availibility times.
- Acceptance Tests - Dev team members logging in.

### Title - Four
- User Story sentence - As a user I would to be able to select my mentor from a listing of available mentors and time schedules.
- Feature Tasks - Implement accordion containing mentor avatar, name and next avaliable session.
- Acceptance Tests - Dev member schedle sessions with dummy seed data.
